# Cameras

Want to maximize:

- Number of Cameras
- Framerate (temporal precision)
- Resolution (Spatial precision)

...but all of these factors contibute differently to the total bitrate of the system, which is a fundamental technological bottleneck
    - i.e. we are limited by how fast we can write the data to disk while ensuring synchronization, etc
    - We should be able to kill it with money though, if we buy a Beefy Enough PC 
    - At that point, we'll have to make calls based on camera sensor vs expected reward

Top of my head, we'll want: 

1. 4-8 cameras
1. 120-240 frames per second
1. (whatever the highest viable resolution is, considiering the two points above)
