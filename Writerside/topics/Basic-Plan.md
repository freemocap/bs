# Basic Plan

- The plan is to record the entire perceptual/motor/environment aspects of the animal's life

- The ability to precisely control and measure the perceptual motor and environmental aspects of the animals life will provide an unprecedented level of detail into the way that neural developmental processes are shaped by experience
