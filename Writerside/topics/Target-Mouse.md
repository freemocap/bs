# Target Mouse

A little motorized mouse with food on it that can zip around the arena on predfined and highly precise trajecoties. 

We can manipulate the statistics of these trajectories in:
 - world-centered coordinates
   - e.g. mouse only appears on the right side of the arena 
 - body-centered coordinates
   - e.g. target only appears to animal's right
 - target-centered coordinates 
   - e.g. the target is more likely to turn right than left
