# Behavioral Development Profiles

 Information on the developmental stages of ferret vision and perceptuomotor abilities, categorized week-by-week post eye opening.
 
Basically, come up with a bunch of metrics that we believe correlate with "Good" behavior, look at how those metrics evolve in different behavioral conditions. 

We can look for: 
 - Across the board deficits
   - Evidence of global developemental delay 
   
 - Deficits along specific task dimensions
   - e.g. what does the [Binocular Vergence](Binocular-Vergence.md) trajecotry look like with different amounts of binocular vs monocular conditions?

   - e.g.Colloquial:  
     - Manipulate the statistics of how often the food/target appeared on the right visual field and see what that does to [superior colliculus]
