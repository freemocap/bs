# Post Hoc Analysis Pipelines

This represents all the things we can do "after the fact" - that is, with a workflow that looks like: 

- Calibrate/Validate system
- Plan Behavioral landscape
  - i.e. what will the subject/animal be doing in this recording? 
  - We can set this up by planning a stimulus pattern (i.e. [Target Mouse](Target-Mouse.md) trajectory)
- Record empirical measurements 
  - i.e. videos
- Process data
  - re-processing ad nauseum:
    - as part of system development,
    - as new computational methods are developed
- Analyze data
  - Post-hoc
