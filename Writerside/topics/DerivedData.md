# Derived  Data

Derived data is computed based on manipulations/transformations/computations of [Raw Data](RawData.md)

It can be saved/cached as needed to save the time needed to re-process it, but in general it is not as precious as [Raw Data](RawData.md)

By definition, [Derived Data](DerivedData.md) can be re-generated ad infinitum, provided the [Raw Data](RawData.md) is intact
