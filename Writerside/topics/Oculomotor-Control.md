# Oculomotor Control

Eyeball [Kinematics](Kinetic-Data.md):

- Eye Movements
  - Saccade
    - Frequency
      - Number of saccades above threshold magnititude per second
    - Amplitude
      - Statistics of saccade amplitudes
    - Direction
      - Statistics of saccade directions, relative to:
        - previous fixation
        - eye-in-head coordinates 
      - Probably:
        - During locomotion:
            - Saccade up, track down
        - During Search:
          - Saccade laterally, track medially
        - During Pursuit of [Target Mouse](Target-Mouse.md)
          - Saccade towards target's expected location/emergence point
        
  - Fixational accuracy 
    - Gaze-in-world dispersion during fixation/tracking
  - Vergence
    - Should verge appropriately when saccading/tracking farther or closer
  - Torsion
    - Whats up with torsion? What's that guys deal?
