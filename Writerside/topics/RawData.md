# Raw Data

Raw data is: 
- Straight off the sensor
- An emprical measurement
- Things that are recorded ONCE during the behavior in question
- By definition, RAW DATA CANNOT BE RE-RECORDED

- Therefore, Raw Data is precious and fragile and must be protected.
- It is NEVER manipulated directly (i.e. via Excel), it is ONLY loaded into Memory, manipulated/transformed via computation to produce [Derived Data](DerivedData.md)
