# Division of Integrative Organismal Systems Core Programs (IOS) - Neural Systems - NSF 24-546

- Project Page: https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/neural-systems

Abridged Synopsis: 


> The Neural Systems Cluster supports **mechanistic** studies in neuroscience, from structure to function in **natural context**, that span **multiple levels** of analysis, from molecular and cellular to **complex behavioral** aspects of organisms.   The Cluster encourages the use of *comparative approaches*, studies of organisms in their **natural contexts**, and the development of novel theoretical, computational, and transdisciplinary approaches to guide and instruct experimental design. 
> 
> Proposals should be submitted to one of the three programs below:  
> 
> **Organization Program**: how the nervous system is organized along **developmental**, genetic, molecular, and cellular lines; explorations of **developmental** mechanisms; and how **experiential/environmental interactions** affect basic *structural and functional *characteristics of the nervous system.
> 
> **Activation Program**: research focused on how *signals from the external environment* **activate** the nervous system, and how the nervous system integrates **sensorimotor responses** to **trigger an action.** 
> 
> **Modulation Program**: research focused on mechanisms mediating **organism-environment interactions**, including, but not limited to, **synaptic, circuit, and behavioral plasticity;** social and emotional regulation of behaviors; neuroendocrine and neuroimmune function; biological rhythms and other complex functions.

NOTES
 - There is also an "IntBio" track explicitly for research that spans multiple categories
 - These three tracks seem VERY similar, so need to focus on details of differences between them
