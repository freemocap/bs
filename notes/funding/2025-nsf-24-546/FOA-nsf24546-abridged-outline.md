# FOA NSF - 24-546 -  Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)

> NOTE - Going through the FOA and copying out the repetitive phrasing, which we can then boil down into a more specific-to-us kinda outline 
## Sub-programs (?)

## Two tracks 
> JSM - We should go IntBio

### Core Programs Track
- supports research to understand why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do
    - developmental biology and the evolution of developmental processes
    - development, structure, modification function and evolution of the nervous system
    - biomechanics and functional morphology
    - physiological processes
-  Proposals should focus on organisms as a fundamental unit of biological organization
- Systems approaches that will lead to conceptual and theoretical insights and predictions about emergent organismal properties.

#### Interests
- Understand the forces behind form
- Predict why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do in a variety of developmental, physiological, and natural environmental contexts. 

#### Seeks projects that:
- Combine experimentation, computation, and modeling,
- Lead to new *conceptual and theoretical insights* and **testable predictions** about **integrated organismal properties** 
 - Integrate data across **spatial/temporal/biological scales**
 - Leads to transformative methods, tools, and resources,
 - Seeks breakthroughs in the understanding of **complex traits** and **emergent properties** of organisms (e.g., **robustness, resilience**)

### Integrative Research in Biology (IntBIO) Track <-(Target)

- Collaborative proposals to tackle bold questions in biology that require an **integrated approach** to make substantive progress
- "Spans sub-disciplines"
- Discovery that is synergistic, such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
- Novel, holistic understanding of how biological systems function and interact across different scales of organization
