# FOA NSF - 24-546 -  Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)

## Research tracks
> JSM - I think we should go IntBio combining all three sub-programs of the **Neural Systems Cluster**   and the Biomechanics sub-program of the **Physiology and Structure Systems Cluster** 

> We can/should nod towards behavioral and developmental clusters, but I think those clusters wouldn't like us as much

### Core Programs Track 
> Can be supported by one sub-program/cluster??
- supports research to understand why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do
    - developmental biology and the evolution of developmental processes
    - development, structure, modification function and evolution of the nervous system
    - biomechanics and functional morphology
    - physiological processes
-  Proposals should focus on organisms as a fundamental unit of biological organization
- Systems approaches that will lead to conceptual and theoretical insights and predictions about emergent organismal properties.

#### Interests
- Understand the forces behind form
- Predict why organisms are structured the way they are and function as they do in a variety of developmental, physiological, and natural environmental contexts. 

#### Seeks projects that:
- Combine experimentation, computation, and modeling,
- Lead to new *conceptual and theoretical insights* and **testable predictions** about **integrated organismal properties** 
 - Integrate data across **spatial/temporal/biological scales**
 - Leads to transformative methods, tools, and resources,
 - Seeks breakthroughs in the understanding of **complex traits** and **emergent properties** of organisms (e.g., **robustness, resilience**)

### Integrative Research in Biology (IntBIO) Track 

>  Requires support from two or more sub-program/clusters??

- Collaborative proposals to tackle bold questions in biology that require an **integrated approach** to make substantive progress
- "Spans sub-disciplines"
- Discovery that is synergistic, such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
- Novel, holistic understanding of how biological systems function and interact across different scales of organization


## Clusters and sub-programs
### **Neural Systems**: 
https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/neural-systems

- Supports mechanistic studies in neuroscience that:
    - Examine structure to function in natural context,
    - Span multiple levels of analysis, from molecular and cellular to complex behavioral aspects of organisms.  
- Encourages:
 - The use of comparative approaches
 - Studies of organisms in their natural contexts, 
 - Development of novel theoretical, computational, and transdisciplinary approaches to guide and instruct experimental design. 
 #### Sub-programs
 - **Organization Program** 
    - (Program Code: 7712; Laura Borodinsky, (703) 292-4958, lborodin@nsf.gov) 
    - supports research on how the nervous system is organized along:
        - developmental, 
        - genetic, 
        - molecular,
        - cellular; 
    - explorations of developmental mechanisms; 
    -  how experiential/environmental interactions affect basic structural and functional characteristics of the nervous system.

 - **Activation Program**
    - (Program Code: 7713; Paul Forlano, (703) 292-46111, pforlano@nsf.gov)
    - How signals from the external environment activate the nervous system
    - How the nervous system integrates sensorimotor responses to trigger an action. 

 - **Modulation Program**
    - (Program Code: 7714; Edda Floh Thiels, (703) 292-8167, ethiels@nsf.gov; Melissa J. Coleman, (703) 292-2657, melcolem@nsf.gov) 
    - Focused on mechanisms mediating organism-environment interactions, 
    - synaptic, circuit, and behavioral plasticity; 
    
### **Physiology & Structural Systems**
https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pss-physiological-structural-systems

- Supports research on whole-organism physiology and functional morphology, including:
    - organismal structural features (e.g. biomechanics??)
- Encourages submission of proposals aimed at:
    1) identifying fundamental mechanistic principles of physiological and structural systems, 
    2) understanding how and why particular morphological and physiological mechanisms have evolved, and 
    3) how they are integrated at the level of the whole organism.
-  Multidisciplinary research that interfaces with biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science and engineering is also encouraged. 
#### Subprograms
- **Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program (PMB)**
    - (Program Code 7658, Kathryn Dickson, (703) 292-7380, kdickson@nsf.gov; Miriam Ashley-Ross, (703) 292-4997, mashleyr@nsf.gov)
    - Mechanisms of physiological processes and biomechanics in the context of the whole organism, 
    - studies of physiological plasticity and adaptation.  B
    - Energetics, muscle physiology, biomechanics, and functional morphology.  
    - Projects that integrate across levels of biological organization, use modeling approaches to predict physiological or biomechanical principles of organismal function, and move beyond correlational results to test mechanistic hypotheses are encouraged.  
- **Integrative Ecological Physiology Program (IEP)** 
    - (Program Code: 7657, Theodore Morgan, (703) 292-7868, tmorgan@nsf.gov; Patrick Abbot, (703) 292-4740, dkabbot@nsf.gov; Keith Reinhardt, (703) 292-4854, kreinhar@nsf.gov) 
    - Supports research on:
        -  genetic, biochemical, morphological and physiological mechanisms underlying organismal responses to their abiotic and biotic environments.  
        - Ecological or evolutionary contexts that test integrative hypothesis aimed at understanding the mechanisms involved in how organisms evolve and respond to dynamic and/or stressful environments.
        - Proposals integrating an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships with theoretical or conceptual models of organismal responses to their environments and comparative studies across multiple organismal systems are encouraged.

### **Behavioral Systems**
https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/behavioral-systems
 - "Integrative animal behavior" - how and why individuals and groups of animals do what they do in nature
 Seeks projects that cross multiple levels of analysis to uncover connections between behavioral:
    - development, 
    - mechanisms,
    - adaptive value, 
    - evolutionary history 
-  Seeks research driven by behavioral questions
    - projects that use behavior as an assay to answer questions about physiology, neuroscience or other areas of organismal biology are not appropriate and should go to one of the other clusters in IOS as described. (JSM - What does this mean???)

#### Sub-programs
- Animal Behavior Program

### **Developmental Systems**
https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/developmental-systems
- Supports research aimed at understanding how interacting developmental processes give rise to the emergent properties of organisms
- particularly interested in understanding how emergent properties result in the development of complex phenotypes and lead to the evolution of developmental mechanisms.
#### Sub-programs
(??? - confusing, might explicitly exclude anything about neurodevelopment, in favor of 'Neural Systems' cluster)
