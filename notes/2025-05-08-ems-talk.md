1. Get the one recording modeled (in blender) as well as we can

- Try to apply the same DLC model to the other data
    - other animal
    - other time point

# things to try DLC-wise

- Use existing DLC model to analyze another data set and see how it does?
? - Should we try to make ONE GIANT MODEL that tracks everything? Or Bespoke model per animal? Or one base model that we adapt per animal? 

# things to try analysis-wise

- Show side-by-side comparisons between same animal at different timepoints 

# Make multi-view sync video of eyes + behavior (4-29 recordings)
